# üìä Scalar Assignment: NPS Data to Strategic Operations Framework üéØ  

This repository presents a **comprehensive Data Analyst & Strategic Operations project** completed as part of an assignment for **Scaler**.  

The primary objective was to **transform inconsistent NPS (Net Promoter Score) support ticket data into actionable strategic insights**, and to design a **sustainable monitoring framework** that drives **operational excellence** and enhances **learner experience**.

## ‚ú® Key Project Phases & Contributions  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Quality & Governance Audit   
- **Audit:** Conducted a deep data audit to identify inconsistencies, such as:  
  - Missing critical fields (dates, assignments)  
  - Logical errors (Status‚ÄìSub-Status mismatches)  
  - Duplicate records  
- **Prevention:** Proposed **data validation rules** and **standardized entry protocols** to ensure long-term data accuracy and governance.  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Strategic Pattern Analysis & Prioritization   
- **High-Impact Prioritization:** Ranked and analyzed the **Top 5 most critical issue types** using a weighted score (frequency √ó impact).  
- **Scope Mapping:** Distinguished between **cross-program (systemic)** issues vs. **program-specific (isolated)** ones.  
- **Efficiency Gains:** Analyzed resolution time by issue category to pinpoint the **highest-leverage operational fix**.  
- **Trend Analysis:** Explored **weekly/monthly ticket volumes**, issue distribution across programs, and **team performance benchmarks**.  

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring Framework Design  
- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** Performed deep RCAs on the **Top 3 critical issues**, tracing them back to underlying operational processes.  
- **KPI Dashboard (Conceptual Design):** Outlined core metrics, review cadence (weekly/monthly), stakeholder mapping, and escalation pathways.  
- **Future-Proofing:** Recommended **automation opportunities** and **process improvements** for sustained efficiency and resource optimization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies  
- **Core Analysis:** Microsoft Excel (with equivalent workflows possible in Python/Pandas)  
- **Documentation:** Markdown (README)  
- **Deliverables:** Conceptual Dashboard Design & Monitoring Framework Document
